'''
A language model gives some probability distribution over the words in a sequence. We can essentially feed sequences into a recurrent neural network and train the model to predict the following word. Note that this doesn’t require any additional data labeling. The words themselves are the labels. This means we can utilize all 75000 reviews in the training set.

'''Unlike before, the final layer has more outputs (called decoder) and we no longer do any sort of pooling. Each output of the sequence will be used separately for calculating a particular loss and all of the losses within a sequence will be summed up. The decoder layer has an input dimension the same size as no_of_hidden_states and the output size is the same as the vocab_size. After every timestep, we have an output for a probability distribution over the entire vocabulary.

After looping through from i=0 to i=no_of_timesteps-1, we have outputs for i=1 to i=no_of_timesteps stored in target_prediction. Notice the variable target is simply the input sequence x[:,1:] without the first index.

Lastly, we’ll start off with three stacked LSTM layers. The task of predicting the next word is far more complicated than predicting sentiment for the entire phrase. We don’t need to be as worried about overfitting since the dataset is larger (although it’s still an issue).'''
